# Projects for Winter Break 2020

This is an active repository where we will upload general programming problems for you to work on over the winter break.
These problems will be language neutral (so you can complete them in any language), but we might recommend certain languages so that you can get experience working in them.

## Problem upload order

1. FizzBuzz
2. Babelfish
3. Goldbach's Conjecture

## Instructions
1. Start by forking [*this repository*](https://github.com/LeTourneau-ACM/winter-break-projects) (click the button that says fork) so that you will have a custom version to work on. A fork is just a copy of a repository for you to edit. This forked repository belongs to you and is where you will do your work.

2. Now you want to clone **your repository** to your own computer in order to work on it.
   1. Open a command prompt or bash window where you want to work (maybe C:\\Documents?)
   2. **Copy your forked repository's URL**

   3. Type in `$ git clone your-repository-url.git`
   4. Now you can start working.

3. Add your solution to that problem's folder and, when you're done, push it to your forked repository.
   1. Make sure your computer knows your git credentials:
      1. `$ git config user.name username`
      2. `$ git config user.email email`
   2. Then you can push your changes to your remote repository
   3. `$ git add problem.solution.lang`
   4. `$ git commit`
      1. This will open a window for you to edit your message in. Treat this like an email: brief header, larger body.
   5. `$ git push`

4. When your repository becomes out of date due to changes on the main repo (which will happen), **_make sure your changes are saved in a commit_**, then run `git pull https://github.com/LeTourneau-ACM/winter-break-projects.git` to catch up.
5. Once your changes are live, send a message on the Discord server for your solution to get credit for completing a problem!
6. Check back weekly for solutions and new problems!

*Note: We expect there will be a reward for those who complete a significant portion of the problems over break.*
